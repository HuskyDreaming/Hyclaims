# 🗺️ Atlas

Atlas is a work in progress land claiming system for Hytale servers, built with a strong focus on correctness, performance, and long term maintainability.

Because Hytale has not yet been released, Atlas is currently developed as a core library, with gameplay features being added progressively as the server API becomes available.

--- 

## Planned Features

These features are planned but not yet finalized:
- Player and admin commands
- Persistence (SQL or other backends)
- Configurable defaults and limits
- Economy including taxes and cost of transactions
- Integration hooks for other plugins
- Visualization and debugging tools

The goal is to implement these incrementally and correctly, rather than rushing API dependent code.

## Contributing

Atlas is still evolving, and contributions are welcome.
Please keep changes focused, well-documented, and tested where appropriate.
